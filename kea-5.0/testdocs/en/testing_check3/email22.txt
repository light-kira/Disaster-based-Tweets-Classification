Title: Investigation on stability mechanism and behaviour of waxy crude oil emulsion from basins in Malaysia Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects

Dear Associate Professor Azuraien Japper-Jaafar,

I have now had a chance to look closely at your submission and I find that even though the material presented is appropriate for Colloids and Surfaces A, and the referencing format has improved substantially (although reference 18 is still not completeâ€¦ is it a MSc or PhD  thesis? How many pages? ) from the first version, the standard of English is not at a level that I am prepared to accept for this journal. I strongly recommend you have your manuscript fully edited by a professional manuscript editing service or seek the help of a native English speaker to correct the many issues of grammar that appear in your document.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider your work.


Yours sincerely,

Franz Grieser, PhD
