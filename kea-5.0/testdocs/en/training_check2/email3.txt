Dear Surya Nedunchezhiyan Thank you so much for your interest. You mean that
if it accepted, about - months it longs for published at the journal. After
that date immediately you published or not. Sorry, I am asking because of my
country criteria. If I need to delay the article published data is it possible
or not? This my last question :) best mehmet
