Editor, I was wondering if there are updates regarding our manuscript with ID
INS-D--. It is more than one year and we still do not know if the submitted
paper will be considered or not for publication at Information Sciences (or
perhaps considering a revision). It would be useful for us to obtain at least
a first decision. Please let me know if there is anything from our side that
we could do to assist you with the revision process. Best regards, Dr. Lorenzo
Livi
