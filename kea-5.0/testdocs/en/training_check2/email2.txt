Dear Dr. Demir, Thank you for choosing JLI to submit your work and I would
like to let you know that the acceptance of an article will be decided only by
the editor. The editor may or may not choose to send your manuscript to review
based on the novelty of the research and we aim to complete the review process
within days if he choose to send the manuscript to review. However, this will
change according to the availability of the reviewers. If accepted we will
take - weeks to complete the production process. Also, we do not have any font
restriction to submit the manuscript. Please let me know if I could be of any
further help. Kind Regards, Surya Ms. Surya Nedunchezhiyan Journal Manager
