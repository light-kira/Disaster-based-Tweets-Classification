Dear Claartje,   Please find attached my completed ATS worksheet to begin
cascades from Process Biochemistry (PRBI) and Enzyme and Microbial Technology
(ENZMICTEC) to Biotechnology Reports (BTRE). There is already a cascade from
Journal of Biotechnology (JBIOTEC) to BTRE. The cluster is BTECH. Please let
me know if you need additional information.   Thank you and best wishes, Lynn
