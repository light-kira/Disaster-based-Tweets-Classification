Dear Dr Scitotenv,   I hope this mail finds you well.   I am lead author on
the Water, Sanitation & Hygiene chapter for the Disease Control
Priorities, Edition . The chapter is now ready. As chapter authors, we have
been encouraged to publish our papers in an open access journal before the
book is itself published, and the Science of the Total Environment seems a
good fit for the topic of the chapter. In this edition of DCP, there are the
usual sections on burden of disease and effectiveness of interventions, but
with increased focus on economic tools for decision making (damage costs,
cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses).   Would the Science of the
Total Environment be interested if we were to submit the chapter, converted to
a journal article (in terms of length)? What is the maximum length for a
review article?   With best wishes,   Guy     Guy HuttonSenior EconomistWater
