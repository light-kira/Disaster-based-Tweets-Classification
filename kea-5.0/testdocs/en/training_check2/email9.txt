Dear Editor Its my pleasure to receive the email about asking my opinion
whether the manuscript is appropriate for publication in Materials Research
Bulletin. Therefore, I have carefully read the manuscript (No MRB--). But I am
unfamiliar with the research content of the manuscript, so Im afraid I
cant give impartial review. I am sorry about I cant review the
manuscript.     Sincerely yours,   Ma Ruiting School of
