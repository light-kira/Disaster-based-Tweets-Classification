Dear Dr. Busman,  Thank you for your interest in Learning and Instruction. I
have now read your abstract and based on what I have read, I think that,
although the topic of your study is interesting and relevant, the paper does
not sufficiently fit the focus of Learning and Instruction. This journal is an
international journal publishing empirical articles that investigate the
effects of instructional manipulations on learning and bring a theoretical
message. Typically, articles in this journal embed the empirical study
thoroughly in the international literature on learning and instruction. Your
paper is not focused on learning and instruction and the study is not embedded
in the literature on learning and instruction. I think other journals in the
field may be a better outlet for your paper.   Kind regards,   Jan Vermunt
Editor-in-Chief Learning and Instruction
