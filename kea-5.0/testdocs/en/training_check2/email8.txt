Dear Dr. Zenker, Thank you for choosing JLI to submit a proposal and I am
sorry to let you know that the proposals for JLI are accepted once a year and
the notification is posted in the journal home page. Please look out for the
announcement later this year as we have already finalized proposals submitted
in . Please let me know if I could be of any further help. Kind Regards, Surya
