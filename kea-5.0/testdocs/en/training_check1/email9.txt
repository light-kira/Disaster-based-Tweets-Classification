Dear Editor
It&#39;s my pleasure to receive the email about asking my opinion whether the manuscript is appropriate for publication in Materials Research Bulletin. Therefore, I have carefully read the manuscript (No MRB-15-128). But I am unfamiliar with the research content of the manuscript, so I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t give impartial review. I am sorry about I can&#39;t review the manuscript.

Sincerely yours,
