Dear Professor Neilson,

 

In submitting a paper to the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, I encountered a problem. In the instructions on Editorial Manager. Authors are told that one of the files that may be uploaded is "Supplementary information". Yet, this cannot be done. How should I submit it?

 

I use Editorial Manager for the journal that I edit and supplementary information can be uploaded. What I suspect happened is that the company that sells the system replaced the "data brief" file for the "supplementary information."

 

My apologies for bothering you about this. I dislike troubling an editor with a problem that involves the online software but I did not know where else to turn.

 

Sincerely,

 

Frank
