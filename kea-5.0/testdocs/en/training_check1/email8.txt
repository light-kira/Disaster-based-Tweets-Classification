Dear Dr. Zenker,

Thank you for choosing JLI to submit a proposal and I am sorry to let you know that the proposals for JLI are accepted once a year and the notification is posted in the journal home page. Please look out for the announcement later this year as we have already finalized proposals submitted in 2014.

Please let me know if I could be of any further help.

Kind Regards,
Surya
