Hi All,
&nbsp;
I am getting in touch regarding a collection of commissioned short review papers that we are putting together; the articles involved will be published in the journals and then pulled together virtually. This was originally borne out of the Engineering group but we are keen to extend this to pull in relevant papers from journals in related areas, including renewable and sustainable energy. We want the reviews to be akin to the papers published in our Current Opinion journals: http://www.journals.elsevier.com/current-opinion-in-environmental-sustainability/, so they&#39;re much shorter and focus on a recent advance (these papers tend to be extremely highly cited). The other difference with these review papers is that we will fund them to be made Open Access.
&nbsp;
For 2015, the commissioned papers are going to be collected around a general theme of sustainability in Engineering. We plan to ask a selection of editors to commission, altogether, 50 papers across our journals. We hope to have the papers submitted early next year (beginning of March) in the hope that theyâ€™ll be reviewed and ready for publication in July/August next year. Once the papers are published in their respective journals*, they will also be highlighted in a gateway website called Engineering Advances, which will host the abstract and title of the paper, and a link back to the article published in the journal (the wireframe of the site will be similar to this: http://www.cell-symposia-transcriptional-regulation.com/). We&#39;ll market this extensively and hope to get some support from the Engineering Academies in promoting the papers (as they&#39;re all Open Access there won&#39;t be any restrictions on readership). We would love to consider a contribution from Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews for this initiative; are there any obvious high profile authors/rising stars that you could contact to put together something like this? I am attaching a list of the agreed titles and authors so far so you can ensure there is no duplication between what is already agreed and what you propose.
&nbsp;
We hope to add content each year to this initiative, and to launch similar initiatives in different disciplines, but 2015 will be the pilot year.
&nbsp;
Let me know what you think and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
&nbsp;
All the best,
Katie
&nbsp;
* We&#39;ll set up a slightly different stream in EES to highlight these papers as they come through review so the administrative process should be quite straightforward.
