Dear Surya Nedunchezhiyan
Thank you so much for your interest. You mean that if it accepted, about 6-7 months it&nbsp;longs for published at the journal. After that date immediately you published or not. Sorry,&nbsp;I am asking because of my country criteria. If I need to delay the article published data is it possible or not? This my last question :)

best
