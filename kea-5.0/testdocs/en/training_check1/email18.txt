Hello,
I would like to submit an article for Appetite, therefore, I have a questions:
1. Please write the article can be translated into English us?
2. Does the references are to be connected to the main text, as in publications in open acces? I confess that I can not do it manually ....
3. How many characters can count article (text + references).
4. How many have to wait for an initial assessment of the publication?


Thank You for the quick reply,
Agnieszka Bywalec
