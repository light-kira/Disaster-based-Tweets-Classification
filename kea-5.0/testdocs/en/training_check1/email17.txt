Dear Nalini Kannan

Hope this mail finds you in a great shape. Well, I submitted one of my research papers ( please see below) to RTP but I had the reply that you would see below. I was indeed very keen to publish it in RTP but since this seems not possible please advise me what other relevant journal that I can send my paper to. 

Sincere regards and thank you in advance for your help
