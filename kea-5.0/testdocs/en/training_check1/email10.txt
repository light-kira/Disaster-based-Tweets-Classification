Dear Claartje,
&nbsp;
Please find attached my completed ATS worksheet to begin cascades from Process Biochemistry (PRBI) and Enzyme and Microbial Technology (ENZMICTEC) to Biotechnology Reports (BTRE). There is already a cascade from Journal of Biotechnology (JBIOTEC) to BTRE. The cluster is BTECH. Please let me know if you need additional information.
&nbsp;
Thank you and best wishes,
Lynn
