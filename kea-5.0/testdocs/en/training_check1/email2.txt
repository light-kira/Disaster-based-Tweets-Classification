Dear Dr. Demir,

Thank you for choosing JLI to submit your work and I would like to let you know that the acceptance of an article will be decided only by the editor. The editor may or may not choose to send your manuscript to review based on the novelty of the research and we aim to complete the review process within 90 days if he choose to send the manuscript to review. However, this will change according to the availability of the reviewers. If accepted we will take 10-15 weeks to complete the production process. Also, we do not have any font restriction to submit the manuscript.

Please let me know if I could be of any further help.

Kind Regards,
Surya
