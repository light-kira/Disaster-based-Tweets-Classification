Dear Editorial Office,

I am looking into publishing a paper in Journal of Arid Environments.  I saw that open access is $2500 but did not see a cost for subscription-only prints.  Can you please let me know how much it would cost to publish a paper in JAE without doing open access?  Thank you!

Sincerely,
Marcella Fremgen
